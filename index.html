										VISION ON DESIGN
									</p>
									<p class="para">
										As technological advancements continue to push the boundaries of what we can do, new ways to utilize these technologies are constantly being explored. Some people picture the futures of these technologies as a replacement for real, physical experiences. 
										<br><br>I disagree, I believe physical experiences will continue to have their place in the ever more technological world. That isn’t to say that these physical experiences are enough. Technology can enhance them, adding interactions unattainable in real life, and making these experiences more engaging and entertaining. Technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) provide new ways to create immersive, autonomous interactive learning experiences that can be accessed from the classroom, home or anywhere else. 
										<br><br>Take zoos as an example. The main draw of a zoo visit for most people is the experience of viewing wild animals. The public sees zoos as a form of entertainment, akin to theme parks. Zoos, on the other hand, would like to be seen more like a museum, with a focus on education. Using AR or VR, educational activities can be made more entertaining, bringing values of guests and zoos closer together.
										<br><br>Making these experiences is no simple task. The technology used is only a small part of the final experience, it’s up to designers to create value in the application of these technologies. Balancing the affordances offered by physical elements with those offered by technology. 
										<br><br>The more technology gets involved, the more skills designers need to be able to design the experiences. Designing these games requires skills in programming, aesthetic design, user experience design, 3D modeling, animation, and depending on the kind of experience, storytelling, sound design, and much more. It’s impossible to be an expert at all of these skills, but knowing which skills are required to create the experience you’re trying to make, and familiarizing yourself with them, helps in creating cohesive designs, where each area compliments the other.
										<br><br>I strongly believe that providing this kind of “experiential education” will help people, young and old, be more motivated to learn. I see a future where they are commonplace in any learning environment, like classrooms, zoos, or museums.

										MY PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY
									</p>
									<p class="para">
										When I was still in primary school, my teacher would try to let us learn by doing activities, whenever possible. For biology class, we would head into the forest to learn about plants and ecosystems. It was fun, engaging and something I found to be lacking during high school, where I rarely felt as engaged to learn. 
										<br><br>Now, as a designer, I’m a dedicated to using technology to create immersive learning experiences. In particular, experiences where users have a form of autonomy, allowing for self-expression and exploration within the environment of the learning experience. 
										<br><br>What drives me in my while designing is not just making part of a product, but how this part contributes to the full experience. I want the full experience to be cohesive, and well thought out. I care for every detail, no matter how small, that might benefit the end user experience. I try to take every use case into account, planning out my designs in great detail, from start to finish. I draw a lot of inspiration from the videogames I enjoy. As a player, I’m often blown away by little details developers add to make their worlds feel alive. I love putting that level of care into the games I make as well, though I do have to be mindful not to be carried away with, prioritizing the most important aspects above all. 
										<br><br>It’s important to involve users into the design process, to know who you’re designing for, and whether your designed solution is clear and effective. I try to learn who my users are, and use these insights to put myself in their shoes while designing. I’ll identify any problems and solve any problems that come up while designing or prototyping. This lets users give meaningful comments on the core of the design, rather than these surface-level problems, when discussing prototypes.
										<br><br>I am very capable of translating my designs into a fully experiential prototype, giving potential users something tangible to give feedback on. Over the past years, I’ve created several educational VR, AR and PC games. Each in-depth experiences featuring fully-fledged environments, intuitive controls, animated characters, visuals, sound, gameplay elements, and learning goals. I enjoy learning new skills I need when developing prototypes. I’m a quick and eager learner, picking up many skills over the past years, like programming in a variety of languages, drawing, 3D modeling, animating and video editing.

										Since starting high school, I’ve been practicing design. In high school, I followed a Technasium track, which involved design projects similar to those at industrial design. This was my main motivation for going starting this study.
										<br><br>Over the course of my bachelor, I developed my skills as a designer, but more importantly, I found my passion for creating (educational) games. I saw how this interest I had, which was mainly a hobby at the time, could be combined with my studies. A huge contributor to this was my internship at the VR company Envsersed Studios. Here, I realized I was quite skilled at programming, matching the skill level of those studying game development. 
										<br><br>I graduated from my bachelor with my project "my Classroom Pet", a VR game in which players are tasked with the care of a virtual pet, with the goal of it teaching kids emotion recognition skills. All info on this project, as well as others can be accessed through the “projects” pages on the left.  									</p>

										Going into my master, I intended to develop myself further down the path I was already set on, educational (serious) games. I chose technology and realization, as well as user and society as the areas of expertise I would specialize in. 
										<br><br>The projects and courses I’ve taken, have allowed me to work on these areas, as well as other skills I needed to develop. I’ve grown and matured a lot during the master, becoming more independent, and improving my skills as designer, researcher and developer. I think my growth in each of the expertise area reflects this the most.

									<p class="para expertise-area-para">
										Starting the master, I was excited to try out new technologies, while improving my technical skills, making more advanced prototypes that could be deployed in realistic settings.  During my bachelors I had almost exclusively worked with VR and PC games. During my master, I would also give AR a try starting with my M1.1 project, and eventually my final master project as well. 
										<br><br>Over the course of the master, I’ve worked with a variety of programming languages. From C# in the Unity game engine, to visual based programming in Unreal engine 4, making interactive prototypes using HTML and JavaScript, and even languages I had never heard of before, like NetLogo, which I had to use in my elective, complex adaptive systems. Each language, or game engine has their own advantages. 
										<br><br>By using a wide selection of programming languages, I have not only learnt how to use any of these specific languages, but the fundamentals of programming itself, which are applicable to any language. This has been incredibly helpful in developing fully functional prototypes. When for my FMP I decided to use websites, this did not pose a major challenge, even though I had never coded my own site before. 
										<br><br>Ultimately, my progress in this expertise area came in the form of being able to deliver fully functional prototypes. Whereas in the past, my prototypes were made for very specific testing scenarios, often needing my assistance to start, my M1.2 protype was a fully-functional downloadable game, complete with saving functionality. Most of the prototypes developed in my FMP have this same museum-quality, being able to be deployed in their intended context without any issues.
										<br><br>I’m really happy with where I am with my programming skills at the moment. The only thing I wish to improve on in the future, is how I write down my code. Back during my internship, there were very clear rules on how to format things like functions, or variables. I’ve never made such clear rules for myself, instead copying the style of whatever tutorial I happen to be following. This results in somewhat messy looking code, which is less readable to others and more prone to mistakes.

									<p class="para expertise-area-para">
										Even though I've always found involving users in the design process incredibly important, during my bachelor this area was a bit of a weakness of mine. Therefore, I intended to involve users a lot more during my master.
										<br><br>Sadly, the pandemic caused me to be limited in what I could do during my M1.1 project, but after this, I made great strides in improving on this area. Thanks to the elective “community Xperience design”, I learnt a lot about using online communities to gather user input. I used online communities to gather participants for my M1.2 research project, which helped in getting 30 people to play my game and participate in my research. 
										<br><br>During my FMP, I had the luxury of working closely with a zoo that let me perform user studies in their park. I made good use of this opportunity, performing a number of studies, including observations, user interviews and user tests, each with over 100 participants. This gave me tons of insights and data  I could use to design, iterate and validate. 
										<br><br>For once, I was also seeing results other than just “it’s fun”, and really got to experience the importance of testing with users. I’m generally pretty good at estimating how a user will interact with my design, but this project revealed some weaknesses in the games I developed. I constantly tested my games myself, on my own phone. This helped me find the majority of bugs in the game, but I was clearly not the right person to test them for usability. I knew exactly how they were controlled, and what I was meant to do.										
										<br><br>When testing with people, I started to see the flaws in my design, parts that were too challenging, or unclear. I am not an avid phone user, so  I did not have a strong idea of what common interactions are. I based my designs on interactions I've had with the Nintendo Wii,  and as such created interfaces where users would have to aim their phone at an object and click a button to select it. This made sense in my head, and in the context of using AR, but most people would try simply clicking the objects, not aim their phone, so I adjusted this behavior. 
										<br><br>Aside from just involving users more, I also took a number of courses, focused on user experience. Especially “user experience theory and practice” and “design for social innovation” helped me better understand UX, how to use different perspectives in design and how to use empathy to gain new insights into your target users that you can use throughout your design. I applied his throughout my FMP. In my M2.1 project I observed, and spoke with guests in the zoo, and I used the insights I gathered there to make design decisions throughout the rest of my FMP.

									<p class="para expertise-area-para">
										My FMP posed an interesting challenge, can mobile phones be used to create interactive educational activities (in zoos)? Research showed that using phones in this context is often met with some resistance, so I wanted to make sure that my designs had an added value for users. 
										<br><br>To achieve this, I implemented a lot from what I learnt in “a designerly perspective on IOT”. Mainly on the topic of affordances. What were the affordances offered by using mobile phones, and how could I use those to create interesting experiences? Answering these questions led to the designs I ended up making. 
										<br><br>Another challenge in this project was to create cohesion between the different prototypes that were developed.  This cohesion was not only created through aesthetic design, but design of the interactions as well. When something was designed some way in one of the experiences, like a method of selecting an object, it was designed the same way in the other experiences. 
										<br><br>In past projects, I did not put a lot of thought into the aesthetic of my designs. Decisions were made based on what I was capable of creating, or assets I had access to at the time. The latter was the case with my M1.2 project, where I used free 3D models to populate my game world. 
										<br><br>During my FMP, the aesthetic of the prototypes served much more of a purpose and was very deliberately chosen, not for convenience, but the requirements of the design. I wanted to avoid adults dismissing the created experiences as childish, so I opted for a mature, somewhat realistic look over a childish toon-like appearance.

										This area of expertise is another one I hadn’t developed much over the course of my bachelor. I would always claim that while programming you do a lot of math, and handle data. While this is true, especially when programming models to reflect real life scenarios like I did in the “complex adaptive systems” elective, during my master I still wanted to do more than that. 
										<br><br>To further develop my skills in this area, I ended up doing a lot of research using quantitative data. In my M1.2 research project, I tried SPSS statistics for the first time, using it to perform t-tests and Pearson’s correlation analyses. During my M2.1 project, I tried doing something similar in excel, but didn’t manage to make as detailed of an analysis as a result. 
										<br><br>For my FMP I went back to SPSS statistics to analyze the large amounts of data I gathered during my user tests. Comparing means of different groups using ANOVAs, and using Spearman’s correlation coefficient to find correlation between the variables I measured. In the end, SPSS  proved incredibly valuable in drawing meaningful conclusions on my designs.

										During my FMP, I worked with a real client for the first time in any of my design projects. This dramatically changed the way I had to approach my project, as there were now real stakeholders involved. In past projects, I always made very “hypothetical” designs, with very little argumentation as to why they would work. This project, I would need “sell” my design to the company.
										<br><br>This involved figuring out ways my design could offer new value to users, or the company. I targeted my designs at a group that is currently somewhat unrepresented in zoo education, teens and young adults, as zoo education, especially the interactive kind is mainly targeted at children. As for values tot the company, my designs could drive more people to download their app, and create a unique selling point for the zoo as currently no other zoos offer something similar. 
										<br><br>It also involved really diving into the feasibility of the design. For this, I met with the people in the company who would most likely be involved in making it a reality, to gather their perspectives on what the current possibilities are. 
										<br><br>Overall, working with a real client has been an enormous help in my development of this area, forcing me to think about aspects of my design I otherwise tended to ignore.

										When it comes to the design process, the biggest development I have made during my master was learning how to rely on myself. In the past, I often relied on team members to guide me, and give me tasks in the process. By no means was I lazy, but within a group I tend to be a bit timid, let others take the reigns while I follow along.
										<br><br>During my master, I was forced to guide my own process, and while this was quite the adjustment, I learnt to do it. Even in group projects, I tried taking more of a leading role, at least in whichever aspect of the project I ended up working on most (usually the prototype).
										<br><br>In my FMP, I particularly struggled framing my project, making it specific. My client gave me the freedom to do whatever, which caused me to keep things very vague. I wanted to do “something with AR or VR in zoos”. While this vagueness allowed me to explore interesting venues I otherwise might have overlooked, I should have narrowed down my focus sooner. Once I settled on educational activities using phones and AR, the rest of the steps I needed to take in my process became much clearer. In future projects I’m definitely going to do a lot better job at framing things clearly from the start. 
										<br><br>My M1.1 project showed a lack in scientific reporting skills, which I tackled in the rest of my projects. I started using reference managers to keep track of sources, which made it easier for me to use a lot more sources effectively. I also become a lot better in reading papers in an effective way. A huge help in this was the elective “design for social innovation”, which had me create infographics summarizing a paper each week.

										Ultimately, I am incredibly happy with where I am today. 
										<br><br>My next step is to pitch my project to the management team of the Beekse Bergen, who will decide whether they’re interested in me continuing my work or not. Everyone I’ve spoken to at the company so far is very excited to see it developed further. I hope I will get the opportunity to do just that. I think my concept has a lot to offer. 
										<br><br>I would to be able to fix the problems that came up during my final user tests, create new content for the experiences I’ve already designed, and design whole new experiences alongside them. There’s so many interesting directions this project can take, I can’t wait to explore them. 
										<br><br>While I am confident I will be able to continue working with Beekse Bergen in at least some degree, there is the possibility I will not. If this is the case, I hope to be exploring other contexts with clients that might be interested in interactive education as well, like museums.
										<br><br>Alternatively, I can look into applying for a position at one of the many companies zoos and theme parks and museums hire to develop interactive exhibitions for them. 
										<br><br>Either way, I’m sure I will find my place.
